I've always loved technology, and security in particular since I could first use a computer. With the advent of GDPR I've also found myself drawn into the data privacy world, and I'm fascinated with how it's shaping our future.

At work, I'm a people wrangler and appsec advocate working with development teams. I'm fortunate enough to travel for work, and I present at conferences and meetups on security and privacy issues in the US, UK and Australia. At home I... still basically mess around with computers and security tools, when I'm not buried under a pile of kids. I also cycle, meditate, play tabletop rpgs.
