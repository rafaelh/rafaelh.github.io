I've always loved technology, and security in particular since I could first use a computer. With the advent of GDPR I've found myself drawn into the data privacy world, and I'm fascinated with how it's shaping our future.

At work, I'm a people wrangler and security champion working with development teams. I lead agile teams working on security, devops and cloud infrastructure. I'm fortunate enough to travel for work, and I present at conferences and meetups on security and privacy issues in the US, UK and Australia. At home I... still basically mess around with computers and security tools, when I'm not buried under a pile of kids. I also cycle, meditate, play tabletop rpgs.
