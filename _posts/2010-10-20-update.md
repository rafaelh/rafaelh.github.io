It's officially my birthday today. I'm finally 33. I actually had trouble remembering what age I was yesterday, it just seems like one of those things that's easy to forget.

Currently configuring Samba to share out my home folder so I can use it for storage and backup. SELinux is playing a lot nicer now that I'm starting to get used to it. Samba continues to be easy to set up and super speedy.

Also, I'm starting to see why there aren't iOS developers everywhere. The administrative barriers to starting to program are pretty high, before you even get to the OO programing side of things. I'll get on top of it eventually though.
