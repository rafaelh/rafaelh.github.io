Places I've been

Seems I have a few places yet to visit. China is on my list for September – heading over there for two weeks to do a variety of fun stuff.

Busy at work… It’s not too bad, but we’ve got our annual ISO 9000 audit next week, and if you’ve ever had anything to do with that you’ll know just how much minutiae is involve getting a company over the line. Fortunately my background as a pedant helps me here. Still, it’s the start of another week, and all is pretty much well with the world.
