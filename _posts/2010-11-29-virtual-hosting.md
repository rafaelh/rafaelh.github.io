I'm extremely happy with Linode; they are a virtual hosting provider that has made it quite easy to move the various services I was hosting from my office ADSL connection, to a nice telehoused facility in Dallas. If anyone wants an email list or website hosted, let me know.

In other news, Amber is almost at her 101st month scan (in binary) or 5th (in Octal, for your convenience). Things are going to get interesting in the new year!
