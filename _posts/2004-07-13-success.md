<p style="text-align: justify;">Yay!
<a rel="attachment wp-att-712" href="http://zencat.electrickinetic.com/2004/07/13/success/yinyang/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-712" title="yinyang" src="http://zencat.electrickinetic.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/yinyang.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>Well, the grading went off with out a hitch, well, without a major hitch. Grading early in the morning before work seems like a good idea when you plan it a month ahead, but I felt oh so differently about it when my alarm went off at 5am.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some reason it's impossible to get properly flexible in the morning, no matter how much you stretch or warm up. I'm hobbling around the office a little bit now, not so much due to the exercise (of which there was a lot), but instead probably my muscles and joints expressing their disapproval at being forced to stretch early and in the cold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did lose my focus at one stage though - I was in the midst of doing push-ups when one of the academy cats (a 5th generation Bengal cat, descended from Chinese tree leopards - gorgeous) came up and headbutted me affectionately. Normally Chan stays clear of the students when they're practising, but he must have felt an urge to break my concentration :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now I just need to start working towards my purple belt in 6-12 months time. Life is good!</p>
