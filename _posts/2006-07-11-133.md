So, my <a href="http://www.3energyarts.com">training academy</a> is having an open day this saturday. 

If you've been thinking about doing some exercise, be it yoga, kungfu, tai chi or general gym stuff, you should come along. I say this somewhat self-servingly of course, since I just like having friends around to train with. 

They're giving away a couple of memberships, having trial classes, the usual deal. They even have a <a href="http://www.ninelives.net.au/3EA_brochure_DL.pdf">purty brochure</a>. 12-5pm.

Anyway, that's enough shameless plugging for now.
