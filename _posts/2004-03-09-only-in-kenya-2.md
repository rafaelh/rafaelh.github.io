I know that a number of people will already have seen these two links, but I just can’t get the stuff out of my head.

Nice use of shockwave, but the creators can’t be balanced people. In other news, life is good, I passed another grading on the weekend which took five and a half hours to complete. I’m starting to have a real appreciation for what it takes to get past some of the higher levels, but I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.

Got up far too early today, and am now at work, staring sleepily at my monitor. I think I want another weekend.

UPDATE: Some time in the last six years, these links broke. Probably for the best really.
