Have I ever mentioned that I hate Ninjas?

This might seem like an unlikely subject for a diatribe, but everywhere I go, pop culture assaults me with veiled references to shadowy Ninjas practicing martial arts that look suspiciously like Kickboxing and Kendo. Some would argue that Ninjas never existed, indeed, they may argue that Ninjas were a polite cover for dishonorable tactics of Samurai (in a Terrorist vs Freedom Fighter kinda way). They may further argue that Ninjas were popularized in the 1970s to sell crap to 16 year-olds. These people would be correct. 

Now perhaps I'm being too hard on the everyday common house-ninja. Perhaps Pat Morita really <i>could</i> kick my butt. However until I'm proved wrong, they can expect my scorn.
