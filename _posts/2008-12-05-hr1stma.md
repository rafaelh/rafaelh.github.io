You know Christmas is upon us when the spam emails start getting festive. Apparently 'V1AG3A' pills are a good gift idea for the holiday season. Indeed, when are they not? 

So, lots of stuff has happened since I last posted. I've been traveling. I'm married. We have cats. All along Lygon St where I work, bizarre lime green and hot pink (the traditional Christmas colours) flags have gone up again to celebrate the time of year.

My life revolves around my gorgeous wife, computers, and roleplaying. What more could I ask for?
