Life is pretty good. <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a> and I are off to India next month for three weeks, to do some sight-seeing, and attend <a href="http://tigger_au.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">tigger_au</a>'s wedding. </p>

We're well and truely moved in to our new place, but we've been spending most of our time running between family engagements for the christmas we're not going to have in Australia, and trying to spend the rest of the time unpacking.

So, anyway, I'm experimenting with Skype for my company. Who else here uses it?
