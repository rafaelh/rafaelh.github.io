<h1><span style="color: #000000;">Cygwin is a collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.</span></h1>
Cygwin is an extraordinarily powerful set of software for Windows that allows you to use some of the functionality of Linux. It includes a well equipped command line environment, compilation tools, an X server, and more. Follow the <a title="Installing Cygwin" href="http://cygwin.rafaelhart.com/installing-cygwin-2/">Cygwin installation</a> menu to the left for step by step installation of Cygwin, X windows, and more.

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Cygwin Configuration</span></h2>
Cygwin can be configured entirely with dotfiles - if you'd prefer to go straight to them, you can download them from GitHub. If you have a bit more time, then this site will hopefully help to give you some ideas for your set-up. If you see anything you can do better, let me know in a comment - I'm updating these all these all the time.
<h3>More Options</h3>
The home of the Cygwin project is <a title="The home of the Cygwin Project" href="http://www.cygwin.org">here</a>, but if you are using it in production, you might want to look at Red Hat's <a title="Red Hart Cygwin services" href="http://www.redhat.com/services/custom/cygwin/">Cygwin services</a>. Alternately, if you are searching for a quick solution, maybe <a title="Babun is a pre-customized version of Cygwin" href="http://babun.github.io">babun</a> is for you?
