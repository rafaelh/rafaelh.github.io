<p style="text-align: center;">So, how does your bathroom look?  This is ours, two days ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bathroom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1205" alt="bathroom" src="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bathroom.jpg" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I remember in the weeks after Zac was born, when I was more than a little sleep deprived (though no where near as much as my darling wife), my brain and I foggily put together an idea. I figured that the next couple of years would be a lot of work; and with that reasoning I thought that maybe we should just do everything at once - rip the band-aid off as it were. With that in mind, I enrolled in an MBA, and we started planning a house extension.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, Zac is sleeping now, and my brain is working a bit better, so it is only at this late stage that I feel we have bitten off a lot all at once. Last week, me and two minimover guys spent 9 hours moving almost everything we have into storage, and we moved into my folks city townhouse. They are only there for 2-3 nights a week, so it does work out reasonably well. We will likely be living out of suitcases and a few boxes for the next four months. In the evenings after Zac goes to bed, I study and work on assignments, while Amber does her Tupperware stuff. Still, this time next year, we'll be glad we've done this. But for now, we have mountains to move, and we can't change course till we've done what we've set out to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alea iacta est.</p>
