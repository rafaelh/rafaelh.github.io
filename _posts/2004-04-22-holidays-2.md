<p style="text-align: justify;">Just saw <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/ddautta.php" target="_blank">this</a> and it definitely gave me a warm “Awww…” feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leaving work in the next few minutes to enjoy another four day weekend – life is good. Lots of people are coming from out of town for a convention, many of which I haven't seen since the last one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s strange how there are some people you know who you only ever meet at these things. I haven’t really been gaming all that much in the last nine months, mostly burying myself in work and training, which has had a positive effect in many ways. Looking forward to catching up with people…</p>
