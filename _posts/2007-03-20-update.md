So, no news to report; so far I'm having one standard issue week. I picked up World of Warcraft recently, and I've been playing on the Blackrock server. Concerned friends shouldn't be worried that I'll become addicted - it's too repetitive to really hold my interest for long. Give me a yell if your occasionally on that server though. 

# And other stuff of interest...
Yeah, this is water - but it costs $40 US per bottle

And for the Goths out there - Black Toilet Paper. Renova recently sold their millionth roll of this recently, and celebrated by making a diamond encrusted toilet roll holder. I'm not sure they know their market.

This would make me nervous. This is the tennis court located at the top of Burj Al Arab, the super-expensive hotel in Dubai that looks like a sail. Apparently there are nets to stop the players from plummeting to their deaths. Personally, I'd prefer to play on a court where nets aren't required.

And here is a cat with two hedgehogs on it.

Oh, and this is too large to make into an icon, but I can't stand not to use it.
