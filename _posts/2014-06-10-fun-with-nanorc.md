Okay, there isn't much that can be done with nano, but it's a handy tool to have installed. It's especially handy when you are messing around with a vim config, and you stop it from working. I've published a basic [.nanorc](https://github.com/rafaelh/dotfiles/blob/master/nanorc) with syntax highlighting and some python friendly options.
