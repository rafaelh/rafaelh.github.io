Okay, there isn't much that can be done with nano, but it's a handy tool to have installed. It's especially handy when you are messing around with a vim config, and you stop it from working. I've published a basic <a title=".nanorc" href="http://cygwin.rafaelhart.com/dotfiles/nanorc/">.nanorc</a> with syntax highlighting and some python friendly options.
