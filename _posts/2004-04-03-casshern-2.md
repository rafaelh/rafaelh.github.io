Those of you who like Asian cinema are required to watch the following trailer.

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TAFFjGol460?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TAFFjGol460?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Come April 24 Iâ€™ll be looking at what is on and appropriately subtitled at the Bourke St Asian cinema.

*UPDATE: Yeah, okay, this movie wasn't quite as cool as it promised to be, but it's worth a watch. I suspect I've been spoilt by the cut down nature of western cinema - anything that doesn't jump from action scene to actions scene just starts to lose me.*
