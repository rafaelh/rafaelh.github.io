After 10 months of running the <a title="Fun with Cygwin!" href="http://cygwin.rafaelhart.com">http://cygwin.rafaelhart.com</a> sub-domain, I'm now getting about 500 hits a month on what is largely an SEO-un-optimized site, and with the other professional sites I've worked on, I've largely come to the conclusion that there are only two rules that matter for driving traffic to sites.
<ol>
	<li>Write something worth reading.</li>
	<li>Write frequently enough that people come back.</li>
</ol>
I've also found that having an outlet for technical posts has robbed me of the desire to update my regular blog, though I chafe a bit at having an exclusively cygwin-related site, since there are a variety of other things that I'd like to post about which don't fit. I like using my blog to look back on past years, so I'm going to dispense with the digital/seo content (see rule 1), and go back to general life updates. I'm thinking about coding a new blog to move away from wordpress, so I'll probably put together another tech-based blog on a different subdomain, and experiment with that.
