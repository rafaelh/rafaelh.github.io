One thing that has become clear to me during the process of becoming a parent is that we've lost a lot of the knowledge that our parent's generation had. So much has been cast aside for political correctness. So without further ado, here are three lessons to start putting into practice:

<a href="http://www.rafaelhart.com/2011/07/12/knowledge-weve-lost/parenting-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-923"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923" title="Coke Zero can be used even earlier!" src="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/parenting-1.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="484" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;">Zac has had barely any cola at all. I feel awful.</p>
<a href="http://www.rafaelhart.com/2011/07/12/knowledge-weve-lost/parenting-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-924"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924" title="Blatz Beer!" src="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/parenting-2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="458" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not only has Zac had no cola, I haven't been providing Amber with any beer. I need to raise my game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rafaelhart.com/2011/07/12/knowledge-weve-lost/parenting-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-925"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925" title="Ahh... at least Motorola is on my side." src="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/parenting-3.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="640" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We don't even have a TV connection. Hopefully DVDs have the same positive effect on Zac's school marks.</p>
