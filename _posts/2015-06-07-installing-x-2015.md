<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first started using cygwin I didn't really see much sense in having X windows, within MS Windows. I think that's because for those of us who became familiar with Linux via desktop environments had limited exposure to the origins of X and some of the things it was intended to achieve - distributed GUI applications on client machines, run off a central server. So when you ssh into a computer, and they both have X servers, and you're using the -X switch to enable port forwarding, you will get the GUI on your computer, while the program runs on the server.</p>

<pre>ssh -X user@server.name

# Then run a graphical program with an ampersand to put the job in the background.
xterm &</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installing X in Cygwin is just a case of going into the X11 menu and selecting a bunch of stuff. You'll get a better environment by selecting more of it, and in that spirit I select the following. They are in one line without punctuation so you can paste them into an <a href="https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg">apt-cyg</a> command if desired:</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>bigreqsproto bitmap compositeproto cygutils-x11 cygwin-x-doc damageproto dmxproto fixesproto fontconfig fontsproto fonttosfnt harfbuzz kbproto mkfontdir mkfontscale rendercheck renderproto resourceproto rgb rstart sessreg shared-mime-info twm xauth xbitmaps xcb-proto xclipboard xclock xcmiscproto xcmsdb xcommgr xconsole xcursor-themes xcursor-gen xdpyinfo xfd xfontsel xhost xinit xinput xkbcomp xkbevd xkbprint xkbutils xkeyboard-config xkill xlaunch xload xloadimage xmessage xorg-server </strong><strong>xorg-server-extra </strong><strong>xprop xrandr xrefresh xscope xset xsetroot xsm xsdtdcmap xterm XtoW xwinclip xwininfo</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And install font-* (all of them)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a lighter (less awesome) approach, try downloading <a title="Xming" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/">Xming</a> and running that instead. Regardless of the approach you take, you'll want to add the following into your .bashrc:</p>

<pre>export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this stage you can start up X in it's own window with 'startx' and it'll look something like this:</p>
<a href="https://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Xwin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-602" src="https://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Xwin.jpg" alt="Xwin" width="1183" height="576" /></a>

For something more usable, start it with:
<pre># You can look up more switches with 'man XWin', but the defaults are pretty good
XWin -multiwindow</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should now have an icon in your taskbar like this <a href="https://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/xicon.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106" src="https://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/xicon.png" alt="xicon" width="18" height="20" /></a>, which you can right-click to start xterms, etc. More importantly, you now have an xserver to run forwarded X11 applications, or launch GUIs for anything else you might have installed.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Starting X with Windows</h1>
In Windows 7, create a new shortcut by right-clicking on the windows desktop and selecting New -&gt; Shortcut. Put in the following as your program, with alterations if you installed in a different place.
<pre class="">C:Cygwinbinrun.exe -p /usr/bin XWin -multiwindow -silent-dup-error
</pre>
Save the shortcut with a name like XWin, then go to Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Startup, right-click on the folder and choose 'open'. Then move the shortcut in there, and voila!

Windows 8 follows a similar proceedure, but to find the startup folder, you'll need to press Win + R, then type in
<pre>%AppData%MicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartup</pre>
