When I first started using cygwin I didn't really see much sense in having X windows, within MS Windows. I think that's because for those of us who became familiar with Linux via desktop environments had limited exposure to the origins of X and some of the things it was intended to achieve - distributed GUI applications on client machines, run off a central server. So when you ssh into a computer, and they both have X servers, and you're using the -X switch to enable port forwarding, you will get the GUI on your computer, while the program runs on the server.

``` sh
ssh -X user@server.name

# Then run a graphical program with an ampersand to put the job in the background.
xterm &
```

Installing X in Cygwin is just a case of going into the X11 menu and selecting a bunch of stuff. You'll get a better environment by selecting more of it, and in that spirit I select the following. They are in one line without punctuation so you can paste them into an [apt-cyg](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg) command if desired:

*bigreqsproto bitmap compositeproto cygutils-x11 cygwin-x-doc damageproto dmxproto fixesproto fontconfig fontsproto fonttosfnt harfbuzz kbproto mkfontdir mkfontscale rendercheck renderproto resourceproto rgb rstart sessreg shared-mime-info twm xauth xbitmaps xcb-proto xclipboard xclock xcmiscproto xcmsdb xcommgr xconsole xcursor-themes xcursor-gen xdpyinfo xfd xfontsel xhost xinit xinput xkbcomp xkbevd xkbprint xkbutils xkeyboard-config xkill xlaunch xload xloadimage xmessage xorg-server xorg-server-extra xprop xrandr xrefresh xscope xset xsetroot xsm xsdtdcmap xterm XtoW xwinclip xwininfo*

And install font-* (all of them)

If you want a lighter (less awesome) approach, try downloading [Xming](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) and running that instead. Regardless of the approach you take, you'll want to add the following into your .bashrc:

``` sh
export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
```

At this stage you can start up X in it's own window with 'startx' and it'll look something like this:

{: style="text-align: center"}
![Xwin]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2015/2016-06-07-xwin.jpg)

For something more usable, start it with:

``` sh
# You can look up more switches with 'man XWin', but the defaults are pretty good
XWin -multiwindow
```

You should now have an icon in your taskbar like this ![Xwin]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2015/2016-06-07-xicon.png), which you can right-click to start xterms, etc. More importantly, you now have an xserver to run forwarded X11 applications, or launch GUIs for anything else you might have installed.

# Starting X with Windows
In Windows 7, create a new shortcut by right-clicking on the windows desktop and selecting *New > Shortcut*. Put in the following as your program, with alterations if you installed in a different place.

``` sh
C:Cygwinbinrun.exe -p /usr/bin XWin -multiwindow -silent-dup-error
```

Save the shortcut with a name like XWin, then go to *Start > All Programs > Startup*, right-click on the folder and choose *open*. Then move the shortcut in there, and voila!

Windows 8 follows a similar proceedure, but to find the startup folder, you'll need to press *Win + R*, then type in *%AppData%MicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartup*
