First they came for my shower, and I did not speak out. Now they've taken my ^&$#ing loo as well. I don't remember any clause in the building contract about them breaking my spirit as well as taking my money. At least I now know why they scheduled 5 weeks for a 3 week job; that's about the length of time it'll take to come down with Stockholm Syndrome. By the end of this process, I imagine I'll be recommending my builders to everyone, with a glassy-eyed look and a desperate smile.

At least, when Cthulu rises, they're gonna get eaten too. That's something.<br />
