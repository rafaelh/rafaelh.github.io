Long time no update. Maybe I'm outgrowing LJ. Is it possible to do that? Anyway, the big news in my world is that I now have a wonderful girlfriend in the form of <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a>. The below photo was taken by an American friend of hers named Traveller, who has taken up residence in New Zealand:

I like this photo, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy, much like Amber does.

In other news, one of my instructors did half a backflip and ended up in hospidal, having whiplashed C4 & C5 in his spine. He's in a neck brace at the moment and having trouble working his hands, but he should get better. In the meantime, I've been running most of the Kungfu lessons, since my Sifu has been out of town. It was a little daunting at first having 40 sets of eyes watching me and waiting for instructions, but it's become very natural quite quickly. The students are giving me far more respect than I deserve :). Sifu Paul is back now, so I probably won't get to do it anymore.

Anyway, I need to empty my Pictures directory.

In Italy, Communication is not a lost art. _(Actually, I don't know where this happened.)_

Ouch. And if you look closely, you can see his dignity flying out of frame
