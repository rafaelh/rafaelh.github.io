I've been wanting to update for a while but I didn't really have much in the way of cataclysmic news. Well, actually, I do have some news, but it seems that almost everyone I know doesn't know anyone I do. 6 degrees my foot.

In a recent post I mentioned climbing up Mount Wudan - one of my fellow travellers has forwarded me a <a href="http://www.world-heritage-tour.org/asia/cn/wudangshan/up.html">VR thing</a> of the summit. Nifty, innit?

I got my DVD copy of <a href="http://www.casshern.com">Casshern</a> which turned out to be a lot different to what I was expecting. I was expecting an action flick, which in some ways is what I got, but it's a very slow paced surreal movie with a lot of fantastic visuals (the director is a famous fashion photographer) and a strong anti-war theme. It reminds me of the stories you get in Heavy Metal comics - it's sort of a cross between Brazil & Bladerunner. All in all, I'll give it an A-.

Now my brother is telling me in all seriousness there are tiny invisible spiders in my breakfast cereal. Apparently they come with the organic oats. I'd look for them, but they're invisible, see? Apparently they give it a bitter taste, so I imagine I'm going to spend the next month trying to detect the taste each time I have a mouthful. 

I don't <i>want</i> there to be invisible spiders in my breakfast cereal.
