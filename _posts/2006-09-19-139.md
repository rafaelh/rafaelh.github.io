Free to good home:

Pentium 4 - 1.60 Ghz, 256 MB RAM
CD Burner, 1.44 Floppy Drive, LAN, Onboard Audio, 20 GB Hard Drive
Fresh Copy of Ubuntu Linux 6.06.

and

Pentium 4 - 2.00 Ghz, 512 MB RAM
CD Rom (No Burning Capability), 1.44 Floppy Drive, LAN, Onboard Audio, 40 GB Hard Drive, 20 GB Seagate Tape Backup Drive.
Also running Ubuntu Linux 6.06.

Just the Tower in both cases - you'll have to get your own peripherals (Keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc). Let me know if you, or anyone you know is interested, 'cause they're just gathering dust at the moment, and they <i>want</i> to be used.<br />
