I should probably blame the irregularity of my posts on something meaningful, like having switched to Ubuntu, or the trials of Christmas, or a series of life-changing events, but in truth, I couldn't find the motivation to use the keyboard. My computer an I are engaged in a staring contest; I’m fairly sure I’m going to win.

It’s going to be a busy few weeks… interstate friends, Arcanacon, a trip to Adelaide, concerts, etc. All this while trying to write an rpg module of doom, the usual kungfu training (I’m teaching now – eep!), hijinx at work, and trying my darnest not to hermit. Life is busy, and that is good.

I have tickets to Slayer! Woo! Not as good as Blind Guardian of course, but I’d be lying if I said I was going to see Slayer for their music; I just want to spend an hour or two in the pit jumping around. I guess that makes it a bit like paying $70 for an aerobics session that leaves you deaf, but they package it so well, it’s hard to complain. Also playing are Mastodon, who I've been interested in ever since they brought out Leviathan, a concept album about hunting whales. Their most recent epic, Blood Mountain, is even more esoteric, with tracks such as “Lair of the Cysquatch”. According to their interviews, a cysquatch is a one-eyed sasquatch that can see the future. Those people are <i>made</i> of drugs.

I don’t know what this is, but anything with Mothra in it rules.

If you don’t get this, you’re probably not a geek. Don’t worry, it’s a good thing.
