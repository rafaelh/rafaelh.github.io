GNU Screen is one of my favourite things on linux, but it also has it's uses on Cygwin. If you are unfamiliar with it, screen allows you to run multiple sessions within a single terminal. There are many tutorials on the net for how to use screen, so I'm only posting a basic .screenrc, which is the file that controls local screen sessions under Cygwin. It's relatively lightweight, but useful. It's [here](https://github.com/rafaelh/dotfiles/blob/master/screenrc).
