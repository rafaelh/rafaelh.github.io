What are your thoughts on gun control? 

I was just sent a videoclip by my brother, who balances my complete apathy towards firearms by being solid survivalist-nutcase material. It's a collection of footage from the 2003 Dry Creek Machinegun Shoot.

I mean, I can see why you need a jeep-mounted 30 cal machinegun to defend your family, but surely most home intruders would be able to get out of the way of your howitzer before you fired it at them...
