<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, tomorrow morning at the blisteringly early time of 6:45am I'll be grading for my kungfu blue belt. I imagine that'll probably entail getting up around 5am to start warming up, stretching and getting over there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assuming I pass this I'll be half way to black belt, though I'm feeling fairly confident, since I've been training 6-7 days a week for 4 months now in preparation. Still, I can't help but have a few nerves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wish me luck!</p>
