Leaving work in the next few minutes to enjoy another four day weekend – life is good. Lots of people are coming from out of town for a convention, many of which I haven't seen since the last one.

It’s strange how there are some people you know who you only ever meet at these things. I haven’t really been gaming all that much in the last nine months, mostly burying myself in work and training, which has had a positive effect in many ways. Looking forward to catching up with people…
