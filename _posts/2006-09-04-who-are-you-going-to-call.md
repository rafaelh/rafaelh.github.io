Apparently my kungfu kwoon (training hall) has a ghost. Two people have seen it now, including Sifu, who isn't a remarkably superstitious type. The kwoon was a belt factory before it was converted, so my money is on one of the former employees being sucked into a leather belt cutter, and thusly walking the halls in search of... I dunno. Maybe revenge or a belt buckle or something.

Personally, I'm not a big believer in ghosts. I have a fan beside my bed, and it is very hard to confuse it for anything other than a fan, but three times now I've woken up in the middle of the night, seen it, assumed it was some intruder crouching over my bed, and promptly backfisted it off the nightstand. The fan is a pretty tough old thing from the 80's, so it still seems to work, but its starting to look a bit the worse for wear, to say nothing for my poor hand. I think this whole ghost thing is probably something like that. And if it's not, then I'm gonna dish out some swift narcoleptic justice on that ghost if it ever bothers me.

Anyway, I have my usual collection of stuff found while browsing, this time themed a little.

Good attitude, Kitty.

Training cats does occur to me as the sort of pastime Buddhist monks would undertake to help them learn patience.
