<p>So, no news to report; so far I&#8217;m having one standard issue week. I picked up world of warcrack recently, and I&#8217;ve been playing on the Blackrock server. Concerned friends shouldn&#8217;t be worried that I&#8217;ll become addicted &#8211; it&#8217;s too repetitive to really hold my interest for long. Give me a yell if your occasionally on that server though. In other news, some interesting images can be found <a href="http://www.pingmag.jp/2006/07/24/japan-underground-photography/">here</a>. I&#8217;m almost tempted to buy the book &#8211; it&#8217;s all photos from underground places in Japan. </p>
<p><!--more And other stuff of interest...--><br />
<b>And other stuff of interest.</b></p>
<p><b>Yeah, this is water&#8230;</b></p>

<p>But it costs $40 US per bottle. That&#8217;s a little over $50 in South-sea pesos (Australian Dollars). See for yourself <a href="http://www.blingh2o.com/store/">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>And for the Goths out there &#8211; Black Toilet Paper</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.renovaonline.net/black/?lmd=38624.448519">Renova</a> recently sold their millionth roll of this recently, and celebrated by making a diamond encrusted toilet roll holder. I&#8217;m not sure they know their market.</p>
<p><b>This would make me nervous.</b></p>

<p>This is the tennis court located at the top of Burj Al Arab, the super-expensive hotel in Dubai that looks like a sail. Apparently there are nets to stop the players from plummeting to their deaths. Personally, I&#8217;d prefer to play on a court where nets aren&#8217;t required.</p>
<p><b>This is just plain wierd, but I like it.</b></p>

<p><b>And here is a cat with two hedgehogs on it.</b></p>

<p><b>Oh, and this is too large to make into an icon, but I can&#8217;t stand not to use it.</b></p>
