So, it looks like livejournal is dying by inches. I guess it’s a slow process, but I’m sure people will move on eventually, especially now that they’ve plastered adverts on some pages. There is a part of me that misses the old Bulletin Board scene, because then you could be sure that 99% of the people online were in the same city as you, and it had more of a community feel. I’d be interested to know who thinks they’ll still have their LJ account in five years.

And on a different topic…

Teddybear Bartenders don’t actually care about your problems, they’re just trying to get you full of milk.
