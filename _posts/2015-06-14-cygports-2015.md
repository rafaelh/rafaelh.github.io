[Cygwin Ports](http://cygwinports.org/) is a repository of binary and source packages that add more software to the base Cygwin installation. Included are a range of full desktop environments, such as Gnome, XFCE, etc. You can get more information directly from the projects' [website](href="http://cygwinports.org").

If you'd like to set Cygwin ports up, you'll need to import the gpg key, and invoke the installer with a specific software repository. This can neatly be wrapped up in a single command, which I tend to alias:

``` sh
alias cygports="/usr/local/bin/setup-x86_64.exe -n -K http://cygwinports.org/ports.gpg -s ftp://ftp.cygwinports.org/pub/cygwinports "
```

You'll need to edit the above if your setup-x86_64.exe (Or 32 bit equivalent) is located in a different spot.

It's important to recognise that Cygwin and Cygwin Ports do not move in lock-step, and if you switch back and forth between the two you will end up with conflicts, though I haven't encountered anything install-breaking yet. If you want large quantities of additional software, the ports project is totally worth it, but if you are just after a package or two, it may be worth seeing if you can compile it on your own.
