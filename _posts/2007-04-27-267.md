<p>Long time no update. Maybe I&#8217;m outgrowing LJ. Is it possible to do that? Anyway, the big news in my world is that I now have a wonderful girlfriend in the form of <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a>. The below photo was taken by an American friend of hers named Traveller, who has taken up residence in New Zealand:</p>

<p>I like this photo, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy, much like Amber does.</p>
<p>In other news, one of my instructors did half a backflip and ended up in hospidal, having whiplashed C4 &#038; C5 in his spine. He&#8217;s in a neck brace at the moment and having trouble working his hands, but he should get better. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been running most of the Kungfu lessons, since my Sifu has been out of town. It was a little daunting at first having 40 sets of eyes watching me and waiting for instructions, but it&#8217;s become very natural quite quickly. The students are giving me far more respect than I deserve :). Sifu Paul is back now, so I probably won&#8217;t get to </p>
<p>Anyway, I need to empty my Pictures directory. <!--more Photos that have been banking up for a month...--><br />

<p>In Italy, Communication is not a lost art. <i>(Actually, I don&#8217;t know where this happened.)</i></p>

<p>I imagine this is how Pepe Le Phew got started.</p>

<p>Not sure what this is about. It&#8217;s pretty though.</p>

<p>Interlude.</p>

<p>Ouch. And if you look closely, you can see his dignity flying out of frame.</p>

<p>Well, at least they&#8217;re staying on message.</p>

<p>I assume this is part of an ad campaign of some sort. Amusing though.</p>

<p>Global warming is just a figment of your SUV&#8230; umm, I mean, imagination.</p>

<p>Heh.</p>

<p>And the cutest photo ever.</p>
