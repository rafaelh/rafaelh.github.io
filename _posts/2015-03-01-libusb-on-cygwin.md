<p>When you next upgrade, if you have installed a package that depends on libusb, you will get a prompt to download and install libusb-win32. The popup contains the download link, but if you don't want to retype it, libusb-win32 is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe">here</a>.</p>

<p>libusb-win32 is a port of the USB library libusb to Windows, allowing cygwin programs that would access usb devices to do so directly. More information is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libusb-win32/wiki/Home/">here</a>.</p>
