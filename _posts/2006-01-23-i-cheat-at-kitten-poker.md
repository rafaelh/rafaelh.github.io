Well, I rather sensibly spent yesterday's 42C weather having my first 2-hour gracie jujitsu class in an unairconditioned training hall. I think this makes me a nutcase.

Friday was also good, having a poker night with assorted non-LJ people + <a class="lj-user" href="http://evil_hamster.livejournal.com/">evil_hamster</a>. My favourite taunt of the night goes to JR; "Lucky we're playing at your place, cause a pretty boy like you walkin' home without a shirt is just askin' for trouble".
