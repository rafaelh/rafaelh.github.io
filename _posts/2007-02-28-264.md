<p>AÃ¯e! The sky is falling on the stock market! Already lost 2 grand today and this is supposed to be only the first of several corrections. Mind you, I can&#8217;t access that account for 26 years, it being part of a self managed super fund and all, so I&#8217;m hoping it will recover by then. The stock market is a lot of fun; it&#8217;s like high stakes poker where everyone leaves the table on average 20% up each year, but it&#8217;s not so fun on days like today.</p>
<p>In other news, my kungfu school has had it&#8217;s power cut due to an administrative error, so last night and this morning was spend training in the dark. Very spooky. And when you&#8217;re in a room with forty other people who are breathing hard, but can&#8217;t see them too well, also more than a little disturbing.</p>
