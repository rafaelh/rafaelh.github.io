<p>Okay, so about once a year I weaken and post a meme. This is a hazardous occupation for me, since the rest of the year is spent giving crap to everyone else who does. Fortunately, being a hypocrite sits quite well with me. It&#8217;s kinda like a superpower &#8211; I use it to fight crime.<br />
<i>And memes <b>are</b> a crime.</i></p>
