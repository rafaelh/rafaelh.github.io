Well, that settles it, I'm off to Canada in October. It's a work trip, setting up a subsidiary company to do airport approaches. Only staying for a week, and most of that will be work, but it should be great fun. I'm going to be located somewhere out of West Vancouver - anyone know what there is to do over there? Stuff they have that you can't get here, etc?

Oh, and I have discovered the painful world that is remedial shiatzu. The pain does come with the endorphin release of stretching, so I've started to look forward to these treatments. Maybe I have a small masochistic streak to complement my obsessive one :).
