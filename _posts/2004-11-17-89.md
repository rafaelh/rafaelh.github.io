<p style="text-align: justify;">Life is good. I''ve finally paid off my HECS debt, which has been dogging my footsteps for the last six years. I'm also finally getting my car tomorrow which will mean the ability to travel beyond the inner city (Public transport is not my thing).</p>
It also seems that I'm coming across a lot of giant robots at the moment.

I've got to get one of these. I wonder if it can dance like <a href="http://uk.download.yahoo.com/ne/fu/oa/eurcncs185030.mpg">this one</a>.
