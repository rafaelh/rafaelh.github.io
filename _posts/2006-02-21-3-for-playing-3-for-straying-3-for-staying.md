Well, I'm now the proud owner of ninelives.net.au, which I have bought so that I might experiment with some ASP.NET. There is only a test page up there at the moment... not entirely sure what I should use the site for - suggestions would be welcome. One thing it does provide though, are a couple of extra email addresses, which can be accessed via POP or webmail. If you would like <i>yourname</i>@ninelives.net.au then let me know. It probably doesn't have a 1 GB email quota like gmail, but then it doesn't spam you with ads either.

I'm lucky to have been able to get a domain name that still makes sense. Some people don't think through the domain name choices they make, for example:

Firstly there is <i>Who Represents?</i>, a database for agencies to the rich and famous:
http://www.whorepresents.com

Second is the <i>Experts Exchange</i>, a knowledge base where programmers can exchange advice and views
http://www.expertsexchange.com

Looking for a pen? Look no further than <i>Pen Island</i>:
http://www.penisland.net

Need a therapist? Try:
http://www.therapistfinder.com

And there is an Italian Power company:
http://www.powergenitalia.com

Finally we have the <i>Mole Station Native Nursery</i>, based in New South Wales:
http://www.molestationnursery.com

I'm going up into the country this weekend to housesit a cat. Farmsit a cat actually. That is all.
