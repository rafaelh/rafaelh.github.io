The unthinkable has happened, and it looks like <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/04/06/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-download-now-3/">linux is coming to Windows</a>. I think a lot of people have imagined what the conversation was like where they decided to do that. It's a great idea. The Microsoft of old positioned Linux as a competitor, but really it's just a tool, and one they can add to their toolset in a way that no one else can. Having a separate blog on Cygwin doesn't make much sense in light of this news, so I've imported all the posts, with the intention of continuing my main blog on things that interest me; technology, security, digital trends and cat pictures.
