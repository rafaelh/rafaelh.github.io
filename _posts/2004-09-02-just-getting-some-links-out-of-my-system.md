<p style="text-align: justify;">This is me surfacing for air. The morning has been filled with wading though a massive form contract and the afternoon looks full of databasey fun, so I'm taking time out for a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I messed up my knee in training on Tuesday, trained anyway on Wednesday, and now it's telling me that it doesn't want to play ball any more.

Secondly, take a look at the following picture:

Squares A and B are the same colour, and the same shade. It certainly breaks my head a little - you might need to take a screenshot and run it through an editing program if you want to prove it to yourself.
