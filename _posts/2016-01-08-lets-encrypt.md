This isn't really a cygwin post, but this site has now been given an encryption certificate via [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/howitworks/). The whole process on debian, from investigating what had to be done, cloning the git repo, and running the single command to create, retrieve and install 5 security certificates took about 3 minutes. Easily the most impressive security service I've seen.
