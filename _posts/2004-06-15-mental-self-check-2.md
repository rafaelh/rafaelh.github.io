<p style="text-align: justify;">Life is good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The long weekend wasn’t too bad, filled with all sorts of fun and frivolity, and a very good party. I imagine a few people had an interesting Saturday morning getting up – a few people were looking quite merry by the time I left. It’s been about four months now since I became a teetotaller and it’s agreeing with me quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve finally decided to get a paid LJ account, for a fairly trivial reason – I like having more than 3 icons. Playing around with ms paint and putting together avatars takes me back to my old days and fond memories of being in the computer art scene, just before I started hanging around Melbourne Uni.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the memories have grown a lot fonder with time – people say that being young is fantastic, etc, but quite frankly I’m starting to become of the opinion that this particular notion is a conspiracy that’s put around by the older members of our society. The older I get the more I enjoy myself, the more options are open to me, and the more I’ve got my life sorted out. Hmm, I’m 26, I’m probably having these thoughts about four years before I should.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, I did find out one thing over the long weekend that amused me supremely – Isaac Newton, who is most often remembered for his work in Physics, specifically for his laws of gravity, is also the inventor of the cat flap. Both are useful, neh?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UPDATE: I have since discovered that Sir Isaac Newton is also the inventor of the kitten flap - he constructed smaller versions of the cat flap in his study for his cat's kittens when she had them :)</em></p>
