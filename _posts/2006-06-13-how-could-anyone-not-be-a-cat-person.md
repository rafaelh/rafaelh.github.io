Not much to report at the moment; I'm hoping I will have something come 1st of July, but we'll have to wait and see.

I saw a t-shirt saying <i>"I do all my own stunts"</i>. I want it. I'm spending most of my time feeling quite sore at the moment; I'm starting preparation for my Black belt grading about 6 months from now, and I'm getting the crap beaten out of me weekly. Awfully character-building stuff, I suppose. I've had a house guest staying with me who has recently departed - I've enjoyed having the company for the past month. Having your own place is nice, but you tend not to spend as much time around other people as you might like. You also pick up anti social habits - I tend to lick my bowl clean after breakfast, and it has been suggested to me that perhaps it's not something to do when in polite company. Eh, anyway:

When the bear climbed down, the cat chased it up another nearby tree. Neighbor Suzanne Giovanetti thought Jack was simply looking up at the bear, but soon realized the much larger animal was afraid of the hissing cat. The cat's owners called it away and the bear ran off. (AP Photo/Suzanne Giovanetti)"</h5>
Heh heh heh.
