I tend to write entries these days when I've found something on the net that amuses me. It's the only way I can discipline myself to actually post stuff. I'm not sure why, but my life seems to fall into a very predictable day in day out pattern, and there is rarely anything I feel worth chronicling, unless it comes with a certificate or leaves a scar. Maybe I just need to get in touch with my inner bore and just throw stuff at the screen.

I smile every time I watch that. I think the above pic sums up my feelings on the LotR trilogy - it was wonderfully entertaining, but it's divergence from the source material got bigger and bigger as the films and extended editions went on. I'm sure you've all read the <a href="http://www.ealasaid.com/misc/vsd/">Very Secret Diaries of Middle Earth</a>. They were good too.
