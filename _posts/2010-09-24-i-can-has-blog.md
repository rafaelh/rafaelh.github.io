Well, it does seem that Wordpress is pretty easy to set up. I had some trouble getting Centos 5.5 to work on 4 raided drives... for some reason it didn't want to install if I selected the <em>centosextras</em> repo. Ah well, it's probably better that I keep this server as a default install in any case.

So anyhoo, I'm Rafe, an IT nerd (mostly of the linux persuasion) from Melbourne. I'm married, with 2 cats and bub no.1 on the way. I've been using Gentoo for the last three years, but I've recently decided to start learning more about servers, for which Centos is my chosen poison.

So far, so good.
