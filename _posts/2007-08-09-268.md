<p>Well hey, I haven&#8217;t posted here in a million years or so. Seems life with <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a> keeps me run off my feet most of the time, most definitely in a good way.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s due to this change in lifestyle that I don&#8217;t feel the urge to rant about anything in particular. Once upon a time I could devote hours into building a hatred of poor internet spelling into a neurosis, but no longer. I guess I&#8217;m going to have to devote some time to that.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll update more often. Possibly not. I’ll continue reading though; that takes less mental processing power than typing in an lj entry. </p>
<p>So anyway, here’s some stuff I found. <lj-cut text = "I used to spend more time looking for these too."></p>
<p><center><b><br />
I suppose this is one way to use someone&#8217;s time.</b> I recently saw a car in Melbourne that was this dirty, and where someone might normally have written &#8220;Wash Me&#8221; on the back, they had written &#8220;Water Saver&#8221; instead.<b></p>

<p>Pretty. It&#8217;s probably from a shaving ad or something though.</p>

<p>This is a commemorative stamp that shows&#8230; high spirits&#8230; amongst the troops.</p>

<p>Not sure what show these guys are putting on, but it looks good.</p>

<p>Classic How-to-be-a-Ninja-Manual bull$#!+, but I have to give them points for coming up with a hilarious name. Monkey steals the peach indeed.</p>

<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
