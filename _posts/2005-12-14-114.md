I broke someone's finger.

I didn't mean to do it, and honestly, I couldn't say how I did it, it just happened. I was doing some light sparring with Chris, someone I train with. We got all tangled up at one point, so we separated, and there was a loud snap, like a bone clicking into place, but louder. He's quite understanding about it, and bears no ill will, but he'll have his arm in a cast for the next six weeks. Apparently he's been training quite hard and was planning to take a <i>break</i>. It's a pun that makes me wince.

Anyhoo, random stuff...
