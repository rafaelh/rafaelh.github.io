We've got a new house! As of Nov 10th, <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a> and I are going to be living on Park St, which is near the Brunswick/Carlton section of Lygon St.

So anyway, does anyone need a fridge? We have an old one (approx 7 years) at my place that is perfectly fine, but surplus to requirements. Free to anyone who wants the bastard of a job that comes with moving it. Let me know soon, because it'll end up as hard rubbish fast otherwise.

Setup of the new place is going to take some time, since we're going to need to clean it up a fair bit, but house warming details for early next year will be posted once we know more.
