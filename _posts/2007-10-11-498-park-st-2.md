<p>We&#8217;ve got a new house! As of Nov 10th, <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a> and I are going to be living on Park St, which is near the Brunswick/Carlton section of Lygon St. </p>
<p>So anyway, does anyone need a fridge? We have an old one (approx 7 years) at my place that is perfectly fine, but surplus to requirements. Free to anyone who wants the bastard of a job that comes with moving it. Let me know soon, because it&#8217;ll end up as hard rubbish fast otherwise.</p>
<p>Setup of the new place is going to take some time, since we&#8217;re going to need to clean it up a fair bit, but house warming details for early next year will be posted once we know more.</p>
