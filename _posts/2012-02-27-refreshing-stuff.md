So, up until recently, I thought that Strontium was pretty much only common as part of radioactive fallout.

What is this crazy chernobyl run-off water I've been drinking I asked myself? Well, after a little web searching, and a conversation with a collegue who is part owner in a Swiss spring, it turns out that Strontium does occur in nature relatively often. Maybe this isn't news to most people, but as a fan of the old [Strontium Dogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_Dog) comic in my youth, it seemed interesting to me.

Mind you, the Nitrates listed directly below means that the water has been contaminated by farming fertilizer, so I think I might switch to a different brand.
