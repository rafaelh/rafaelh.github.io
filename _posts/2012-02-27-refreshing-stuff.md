<p style="text-align: justify;">So, up until recently, I thought that Strontium was pretty much only common as part of radioactive fallout.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rafaelhart.com/2012/02/27/refreshing-stuff/img_0104/" rel="attachment wp-att-1178"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1178" title="Strontium Drink!" alt="" src="http://www.rafaelhart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_0104-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What is this crazy chernobyl run-off water I've been drinking I asked myself? Well, after a little web searching, and a c0nversation with a collegue who is part owner in a Swiss spring, it turns out that Strontium does occur in nature relatively often. Maybe this isn't news to most people, but as a fan of the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_Dog">Strontium Dogs</a> comic in my youth, it seemed interesting to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mind you, the Nitrates listed directly below means that the water has been contaminated by farming fertilizer, so I think I might switch to a different brand.</p>
