Wow, this week has melted my brain. Too much looking through legislation.

In three weeks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_on_a_plane">Snakes on a Plane</a> hits local cinemas. Who wants to come see it? It'll be like watching a train-wreck in action! A novelization and audiobook are currently in production. Not since the heady days of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat:_Annihilation">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a> have we seen such an event.

Anyway, were you aware that while only having 4 paws, it's possible for a cat to have light fingers?

Willy has brought home nine pairs of gloves and five singles over several weeks laying them on his owners' front or back porches."

Oh, and <a class="lj-user" href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/">gypsyamber</a>, I think you need to turn <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v384/zen_cat/060705_foto.jpg">this</a> into an icon.
