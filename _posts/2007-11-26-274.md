<p>Time-wasting Pictures before the text of one of my intermittant updates this time.</p>
<p><!--more I'm mixing things up. Consider yourself surprised.--> </p>
<p>So anyway, to restore your faith in nature, here are a bunch of pictures from Alaska, where the obviously well fed polar bears choose to play with the local huskis rather than trying to eat them.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, what have humans been up to in civilization?</p>
<p><img src="http://lh3.google.com.au/zen.cat.nine/R0pVOE5EQDI/AAAAAAAABYc/2GJOT93Amis/s800/Russian_Roulette_For_Kids.jpg"></p>
<p>Awesome. Russian Roulette for kids. Why didn&#8217;t I think of that? </p>
<p>At least it&#8217;s not like the Australian manufactured <a href="http://www.mooseworld.com.au/content/Bindeez2/Home.aspx">Bindeez</a>, the most recent batch of which turn into <a href="http://www.projectghb.org/what_is_ghb.htm">GHB</a> in your stomach. There are a bunch of envious druglords out there now wondering how the hell a toy company is able to do with minimal effort what they have to pay top-dollar for. If it hadn&#8217;t happened, you couldn&#8217;t use that as a plot in a B movie, it&#8217;d be considered too implausible. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to complain though, life is pretty good. <a href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">gypsyamber</a> and I are off to India next month for three weeks, to do some sight-seeing, and attend <a href="http://tigger_au.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">tigger_au</a>&#8216;s wedding. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re well and truely moved in to our new place, but we&#8217;ve been spending most of our time running between family engagements for the christmas we&#8217;re not going to have in Australia, and trying to spend the rest of the time unpacking. </p>
<p>So, anyway, I&#8217;m experimenting with Skype for my company. Who else here uses it?</p>
