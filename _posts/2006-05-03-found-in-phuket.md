Well, finished my first day back at work and the world is beating a path to my door. It’s nice to come back after a long vacation if you enjoy your job – there is news for just about everything you’re working on, and you have this mystical anti-job-delegation field known as ‘catching up on email’ which protects you for 36 hours or so.

Anyway, I’m told that the following critters were washed up on the shore after the tsunami. I’m not sure how true that is, but these are some strange seafood. Note that I’ve only capitalized official names – some of these fish sticks don’t have names that I can find.

An Umbrella Mouth Gulper Eel

A fangtooth something-or-other. A goth fish perhaps?

A Crab. Of the Warhammer 40k genus it seems.

I’m fairly sure that a certain amount of things like this do end up as fish-sticks. I guess it’s all generic protein, so it’s pretty harmless.
