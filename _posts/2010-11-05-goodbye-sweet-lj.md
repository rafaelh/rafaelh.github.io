<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, maybe not goodbye, but it's not a secret I don't post here much anymore. At first I thought I had stopped posting because I was content (having found my darling <a class="lj-user" href="http://gypsyamber.livejournal.com/">gypsyamber</a> and all, but now I think that part of it might have been me getting lazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amber gave me a series of drawing books for my birthday, and I've been getting back in to creating things. Similarly, I've been working on learning how to code for iOS devices, and it's made me start thinking I should be recording stuff again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But not on LJ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've set up a server, running CentOS 5.5 (I normally use Gentoo for everything) and a basic wordpress blog. It's at www.electrickinetic.com. I'm sure I'll keep on reading posts here though.</p>
